The authors state that the pandemic has affected \ufb01sh supply chain\nfactors such as a lack of technical assistance, an inability to sell the product, a lack of\ntransportation for the \ufb01sh supply, export restrictions on \ufb01sh and \ufb01sheries products and a\nlow\ufb01sh price. Alam et al. (2022) noted low motivation for \ufb01sh farmers, inadequate\nproduction, unanticipated stock retention, a loss in returns and food insecurity for many\nsmall-scale \ufb01sh farmers. This shows that COVID-19 has contributed to the challenges faced\nin\ufb01sh farming in the UK, disrupting the \ufb01sh food chain, reduced livelihoods and economic\nvulnerability.\nBrexit has posed some challenges to \ufb01s hf a r m i n gi nt h eU Ka n d Stewart et al.
